# CodSoft
For Visual Internship ,I am uploading all my tasks for CodSoft as UI/UX designer.

TASK1:

My task was to create a mobile signup app with a signup page that is easy for users to use

and collects all the necessary information we need. A good signup page is one that is user

-friendly and gathers all the required information.

TASK2:

My second task was to create an email template for promotional purposes, and a good email

template is one that is easy to access.and quick for businesses to send out emails that

look professional and engaging.

TASK3:

My third task was to create a restaurant menu that is easy to use and attractive so that people

can easily browse it, find the dishes they're looking for, and place their orders without any

difficulty.

TASK4:

Task 4 involved creating an e-commerce website that is so visually appealing and user-friendly that

people are compelled to make purchases the moment they visit, and it's easy to use even for someone 

using it for the first time.
